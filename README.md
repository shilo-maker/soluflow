## Key Workflows

### 1. Service Creation (Planner)
1. Navigate to Home â†’ Create Service
2. Add songs from library to set list
3. Assign a leader
4. Generate shareable link for guests
5. Share code with team

### 2. Live Service (Leader)
1. Join service and enable Leader Mode
2. Navigate through set list
3. Transpose songs in real-time (broadcasts to all followers)
4. Add spontaneous songs if needed
5. All followers stay synchronized

### 3. Following a Service (Member)
1. Join service via code or from upcoming services
2. Follow Leader (auto-sync) or switch to Free Mode
3. View chords/lyrics with personal notes
4. Toggle lyrics-only mode as needed
5. Transpose locally in Free Mode

### 4. Guest Access
1. Receive service code from planner
2. Enter code on guest page
3. View service and songs (read-only)
4. Transpose songs locally
5. No account required

## Design Principles

**Mobile-First**: Designed for phones with 44px minimum tap targets

**Real-Time**: Socket.IO keeps all devices synchronized instantly

**Offline-Ready**: PWA with service worker caching

**Accessible**: High-contrast typography for stage lighting

**Simple**: Minimal UI, maximum functionality

**Flexible**: Follow the leader or navigate independently

---

## Security

- JWT authentication with short expiration times
- Role-based access control
- Guest tokens for temporary access
- SQL injection protection via Sequelize
- XSS protection and input sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- File upload validation (type, size)

---

## Performance

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Debounced search inputs
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Socket.IO room isolation per service
- Compressed payloads
- CDN for static assets

---
