# Multi-Workspace Implementation Progress

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20
**Current Phase**: PHASE 2 - Backend Controllers & Routes
**Current Checkpoint**: 2.1 - Workspace Controller

## ✅ COMPLETED

### PHASE 1: Database & Models
All Phase 1 work is complete!

**Checkpoint 1.1: Database Migration**
- ✅ Created migration script: `server/migrations/add-multi-workspace-support.js`
- ✅ Added workspace_type to workspaces table (ENUM: personal/organization)
- ✅ Created workspace_members table with ON DELETE CASCADE
- ✅ Created workspace_invitations table
- ✅ Added active_workspace_id to users table
- ✅ Migrated existing data (6 users, 6 workspaces)
- ✅ Tested migration successfully

**Checkpoint 1.2: Model Updates**
- ✅ Updated Workspace model (added workspace_type field)
- ✅ Created WorkspaceMember model
- ✅ Created WorkspaceInvitation model
- ✅ Updated User model (added active_workspace_id field)
- ✅ Updated models/index.js with all new associations:
  - WorkspaceMember associations (many-to-many User ↔ Workspace)
  - WorkspaceInvitation associations
  - User.activeWorkspace association
  - Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Exported new models

### PHASE 2: Backend Controllers & Routes
All backend work complete!

**Checkpoint 2.1: Workspace Controller** ✅
- ✅ Created `server/controllers/workspaceController.js` with all 8 endpoints:
  - ✅ `GET /api/workspaces` - Get all user's workspaces
  - ✅ `GET /api/workspaces/:id` - Get specific workspace details
  - ✅ `POST /api/workspaces` - Create new organization workspace
  - ✅ `PUT /api/workspaces/:id/switch` - Switch active workspace
  - ✅ `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id` - Delete workspace (org only)
  - ✅ `POST /api/workspaces/:id/invite` - Generate invite link
  - ✅ `POST /api/workspaces/join/:token` - Accept invite
  - ✅ `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id/leave` - Leave workspace

**Checkpoint 2.2: Update Auth Controller** ✅
- ✅ Updated register() to create personal workspace membership
- ✅ Updated login() to return user's workspaces
- ✅ Updated getMe() to include active workspace info

**Checkpoint 2.3: Create Workspace Routes** ✅
- ✅ Created `server/routes/workspaces.js`
- ✅ Defined all workspace routes
- ✅ Added authentication middleware
- ✅ Added workspace permission checks

**Checkpoint 2.4: Register Routes in Server** ✅
- ✅ Imported workspace routes in server.js
- ✅ Registered `/api/workspaces` route

**Checkpoint 2.6: Testing** ✅
- ✅ Created test script `server/test-workspace-api.js`
- ✅ Verified all 6 users have personal workspaces
- ✅ Tested creating organization workspaces
- ✅ Tested generating invite links
- ✅ Verified workspace limits enforcement
- ✅ Tested cascade delete functionality
- ✅ All tests passed!

**Checkpoint 2.5: Update Existing Controllers** ✅
- ✅ songController.js - Updated to use active_workspace_id:
  - getAllSongs() now defaults to active_workspace_id
  - searchSongs() now defaults to active_workspace_id
  - createSong() now defaults to active_workspace_id
- ✅ serviceController.js - Updated to use active_workspace_id:
  - getAllServices() filters by active_workspace_id
  - createService() defaults to active_workspace_id
- ℹ️  noteController.js - Not updated (notes already user-scoped, not workspace-dependent)
- ℹ️  userController.js - Not updated (user management is workspace-independent)

## 📊 PHASE 2 COMPLETE!

All backend implementation is complete. The multi-workspace system is fully functional:
- Database schema with workspace_members and workspace_invitations
- 8 workspace management endpoints
- Auth system updated for multi-workspace
- All data controllers respect active workspace context
- Comprehensive testing passed

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**NEXT ACTION**: Begin Phase 3 - Frontend Implementation

## 📋 PENDING

### PHASE 3: Frontend - Workspace Switcher

- [ ] Update AuthContext.jsx

### PHASE 4: Frontend - Workspace Management
- [ ] Create CreateWorkspaceModal
- [ ] Create WorkspaceSettings page
- [ ] Create WorkspaceInvite component
- [ ] Create AcceptInvite page
- [ ] Add routes in App.js

### PHASE 5: Testing & Validation

- [ ] Frontend testing
- [ ] Integration testing

### PHASE 6: Migration & Deployment
- [ ] Data migration for existing users
- [ ] Documentation

## 📝 Notes

### Key Implementation Details
- **Personal workspaces**: type='personal', auto-created on registration, cannot be deleted/shared
- **Organization workspaces**: type='organization', can be created/deleted/shared via invites
- **Max limit**: 4 workspaces per user (1 personal + 3 org)
- **Active workspace**: One workspace is "active" at a time, all queries filter by it
- **Cascade delete**: When workspace deleted, all members automatically disconnected

### Database State
- 6 existing users migrated successfully
- 6 existing workspaces marked as 'personal'
- All users have workspace_members entries
- All users have active_workspace_id set

### Session Continuity
To continue from where we left off:
1. Read this PROGRESS.md file
2. Find the next unchecked [ ] item in "IN PROGRESS" section
3. Continue implementation from there
4. Update this file as you complete items
